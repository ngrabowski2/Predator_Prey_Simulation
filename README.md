# Predator_Prey_Simulation
A Unity simulation that features a predator prey scenario.
  There are two types of agents, a predator and prey. Both the predator and prey will wander about the scene. If a predator sees a prey, it will 
chase the prey until it either escapes or the predator catches it. If the predator catches it, it will 
eat the prey. They prey will wander randomly, avoiding walls and predators. If the prey sees 
another, they will flock together. This can be disrupted by a predator; in which case the prey will 
move away from the predator.
